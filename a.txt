priority_queue is max heap by default
minHeap: priority_queue<int, vector<int>, greater<int>>
maxHeap: priority_queue<int, vector<int>, less<int>>

minHeap: priority_queue<int, vector<int>, compare>
struct compare {
    bool operator()(ListNode* v1, ListNode* v2) {
        return v1->val > v2->val;
    }
};

slow, fast pointer:
1. slow = dummy; fast = dummy
2. slow = head; fast = head->next

std::string::find
return —> size_t (the position) or string::ncos (can not found)



352. Data Stream as Disjoint Intervals

“set”
std::set::lower_bound
Returns an iterator pointing to the first element in the container which is not considered to go before val (i.e., either it is equivalent or goes after).
std::set::upper_bound
Returns an iterator pointing to the first element in the container which is considered to go after val.

std::prev
Returns an iterator pointing to the element that it would be pointing to if advanced -n positions.
